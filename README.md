# 📚 OpenShelf

OpenShelf is a modern and minimal book discovery app where users can search for books, view details, explore similar books, and manage their favorites.  

The app provides an elegant user interface with book cards, detailed book pages, and a favorites system — making it easy to discover and organize your next read.  

## 📖 About the Project  

OpenShelf is a simple and user-friendly **book finder application**.

- A clean and minimal interface to search for books.  
- Quick access to book details like title, author, and cover.  
- The ability to save favorite books for later reference.  

The motive of building this project is to make book discovery **easy, accessible, and enjoyable** for everyone — whether you’re a casual reader, a student, or a book lover looking for your next read.
